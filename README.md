# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Oluwamayowa George and I'm a frontend developer/ UX Engineer. 

I have 9 years of experience in Content, Marketing and Growth Strategy, and one year of front-end development working with React.

I am based in Lagos, Nigeria, but I am very open to remote roles across the globe.

Check out the repos below for things that I have built.
