### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oluwamayowa George and I'm a frontend developer/ UX Engineer. 

I have ovr 8 years of experience in Content, Marketing and Growth Strategy. 

I started programming in March 2020 and I am currently proficient with the use of HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript and React. I am currently learning PHP to increase my skillset.

I'd love roles where I can grow and expand my skillset while learning from more experienced developers.

I am based in Lagos, Nigeria, but I am very open to remote roles across the globe.
